## Project Description:
This application allows users to manually specify a starting location and search for nearby places or services (e.g., grocery stores, bus stations, cafes) around that location, regardless of their current physical position. Unlike most map services that use the device’s real-time location by default, this app gives users full control over the "search from" location.

### Key Features:
- Manual Location Input: Users can enter any address, city, or coordinates to set a custom search location.

- Search Nearby Places: Users can type in keywords such as “grocery store” or “bus station” to find nearby services around the specified location.

- Results List: A list of matching places will be displayed, showing name, address, and possibly distance from the entered location.

- Get Directions: Users can select a result and click “Get Directions” to generate a route from the manually entered location to the selected place.

- Interactive Map (optional): Integrate a map to show search results as pins and the route for better user experience.
